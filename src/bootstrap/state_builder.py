Minimal StateBuilder for Phase 0 (T008)

This module implements the MinimalStateBuilder class that aggregates perception outputs
into a ~50-dimensional state vector for Phase 0 of the Clash Royale RL Agent.

State Vector Structure (~50 dims):
1. Global features (13):
   - Player elixir (0-10, normalized)
   - Opponent elixir placeholder (-1)
   - Match time (normalized)
   - 6 tower health values (as-is, not normalized)
   - 4 phase indicators (early/mid/late/overtime)

2. Hand features (32):
   - 4 visible cards Ã— 8 features each:
     - Card ID one-hot encoded
     - Affordability (can afford with current elixir)
     - 6 basic attributes (from attribute.txt)

3. Game time features (5):
   - Additional time-related features for better temporal reasoning
   - Changed from upcoming card features per user feedback

Performance Target: <10ms processing time
